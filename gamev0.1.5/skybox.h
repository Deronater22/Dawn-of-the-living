	The Skybox class.  Use it to make a sky box that seems to be at 
	 infinite distance, because it moves with you

    Note that the argument to "load" is a directory.  That directory MUST contain
	the files "Front.bmp", "Left.bmp", "Back.bmp", "Right.bmp", "Top.bmp"

	These are generated by the program to build sky box BMP's at ??
